octopus
=======

Tinkering with canvas to create a (hopefully) cute tamagotchi style creature.

This is the result of me toying around with the canvas API in vanilla javascript. 
All drawing is done in code to allow for animation based on parameters. 
I consider this unfinished but i think its already enough to show it to the world.
